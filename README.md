# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Data-Dashboard
I created this dashboard to make Alzheimerâ€™s brain scan data easier  I wanted something clear and visual that shows patterns and differences across patients at a glance. This dashboard is not just about numbers. It makes the science visual and intuitive, so even someone without a technical background can follow along and see what is happening.
