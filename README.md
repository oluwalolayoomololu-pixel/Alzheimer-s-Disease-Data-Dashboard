# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Data-Dashboard
Excel + SQL + Power BI Project | Retail Sales Data | From Raw Data to Business Insights
### Project Overview
I created this dashboard to make Alzheimerâ€™s brain scan data easier  I wanted something clear and visual that shows patterns and differences across patients at a glance. This dashboard is not just about numbers. It makes the science visual and intuitive, so even someone without a technical background can follow along and see what is happening.

### Data Cleaning Process
- Converted Date to proper datetime format
- Removed missing or invalid values
- Created new calculated fields:
  Disease Progression = AVERAGE(All_Disease[Severity
Score])
Scan Disorder Level =
CALCULATE(
AVERAGE(A|_Disease [entropy]),
FILTER(All_Disease, All_Disease[Severity Score] > 0)

```NEW MEASURES
Severity Score =
SWITCH
All_Disease[Label],
"NonDemented", 0,
"VeryMildDemented", 1,
"MildDemented", 2,
"ModerateDemented", 3,
BLANK()

Disease Progression = AVERAGE(All_Disease[Severity
Score])

Scan Disorder Level =
CALCULATE(
AVERAGE(A|_Disease [entropy]),
FILTER(All_Disease, All_Disease[Severity Score] > 0)

Radiance Progression =
CALCULATE(
AVERAGE(A|_Disease (mean_pixel_intensity]),
FILTER(Al_Disease, Al_Disease [Severity Score] >= 0)

Brightness Variation =
CALCULATE(
AVERAGE(A|_Disease[sto_pixel_intensity]),
FILTER(Al_Disease, Al_Disease [Severity Score] >= 0)
``` 

### Power BI Dashboard
The Power  BI dashboard includes the following visuals:
* ðŸ“ˆDisease Progression 
* scan disorder progression 
* radiance progression 
*ðŸ”† brightness variation
* Top demented scans 
* Top healthy scan
* entrophy level  
* structural clarity 
*: pixel intensity

### Key Insights
Key health metrics like disease progression (1.50), scan disorder level (2.92), radiance progression (74.67), brightness variation (78.91), and central brightness variation (127.53)
* Image analytics such as pixel intensity, standard deviation, and entropy for each scan
* Side-by-side comparisons of demented and healthy scans to reveal structural differences
* Entropy and clarity by diagnostic category, showing how non-demented scans hold stronger structure compared to mild or moderate cases
* Pixel intensity breakdown across groups to highlight subtle but important differences
  
### Why itâ€™s Unique
This dashboard is not just about numbers. It makes the science visual and intuitive, so even someone without a technical background can follow along and see what is happening.

### Why Iâ€™m Proud of It
This project proves how analytics can tell a story. By mixing data with design, I built something that is detailed, clear, and actually useful for anyone who wants to understand Alzheimerâ€™s data better.
